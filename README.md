## Features
- The user is randomly generated each load and may look through the recipes, inspect an individual recipes details and serach for a recipe by name or tag.

## Possible Future Extensions
- First is the missed tech to add, remove and view recipes to cook.
- We would like to expand our search option to include multiple tags and words.
- Possible integration of a 3rd party library to allow reordering of our list of recipes.

## Learning Goals
- Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Make network requests to retrieve data
